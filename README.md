### Algorithmic trading strategies for options on NSE/BSE (Indian stock markets)
#### What this project is about
Algorithmic trading uses fundamental analysis of markets, financial instruments to assess the factors that lead to their performance over time. This can help in taking informed
trading decisions. Knowledge is power. Thus, this project does not aim to *'beat the market'* or *'boost returns'*; it is primarily to develop a deeper understanding of financial data
and to use programming to code potential strategies.

#### Motivation
- better understanding of finance, markets, trading
- become comfortable handling large timeseries data
- become comfortable with visualization, summarisation of data
- do a deployment and test it on live-data
